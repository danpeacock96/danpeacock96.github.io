              attainable housing for future generations in our beautiful village.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to give people who live and work in the village more say in how we want
              the village to develop in ways that benefit the whole community. Anyone in the
              community can join as a member for just £1 and have their say in how the CLT is

            <p id="mobile-text">By establishing a Community Land Trust (CLT), the affordable properties we create
              will be community-owned assets, safeguarded by a legal asset lock, protected from
              the Right to Buy and reserved for local people. This will ensure genuinely affordable
              housing is available for local people forever. Any surpluses will be reinvested back
              into the community and can be used to fund other important assets such as
              premises for a village shop, pub/café and/or village hall benefiting everyone in the

            <p>A retired police officer from London, I moved to Ely in 2003.  Seeking to downsize to a bungalow I moved to Little Thetford in January 2019 with my long-suffering wife, Pam.  I have been active in the communities where we lived as School Governor in various schools and teaching young people to sail.  Within Little Thetford I am Chair of the Parish Council and the Friendship Club for our more elderly residents. You will often see me in the village walking our miniature Schnauzer.</p>

    <div class="FAQs">
        <p>Click the following tabs to get answers to commonly asked questions about Community Land Trusts and how it works.</p>
      <button class="accordion"><b>What is a Community Land Trust (CLT)?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>Across the UK, Community Land Trusts (CLTs) like Little Thetford CLT are being set
          up as non-profit organisations run by local volunteers to develop housing,
          workspaces and hold other assets, such as land that meet community needs.
          Typically, they enable people to live closer to work, schools and families. A CLT
          could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop homes for affordable rent for local people in perpetuity.</li>
          <li>Develop homes for sale as shared ownership or discounted market sale to help local people get their first
            step on the housing ladder.</li>
          <li>Develop community spaces; open green space, shared working space and amenities. </li>
          <li>Promote community development.</li>
          <li>Develop in a way which suits the needs of the village community!</li>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><b>Why do we need a CLT?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>With house prices and rents being so high in the Cambridge area, many people find
          it hard to afford to rent or buy a home in Little Thetford, even if they are working full-
          time, lots of young professionals find they are stuck at home with mum and dad for
          longer than they would like. The CLT is set up to provide housing that is genuinely
          attainable for local people on local wages.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><b>What are the benefits of a CLT?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>There are a number of benefits to setting up and running a CLT. Usually, the
          motivation is a desire to create affordable homes that are available to local people
          who cannot afford open market housing or rents. However, often local people might
          take on another challenge facing their community, such as setting up a community
          shop, a village hall or purchasing the local pub when it is about to close.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CLTs are locally driven, controlled and democratically accountable. </li>
          <li>CLTs can set its allocation policy, so it can set aside housing and develop to meet the needs of the local
            area. </li>
          <li>CLTs, by retaining an equity share in each property, provide housing that is permanently affordable,
            benefitting many generations of residents.</li>
          <li>CLTs give the community an asset for the future. </li>
          <li>CLTs genuinely empower local communities, where communities are part of the vision and solution for their
            local area. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><b>How does membership work?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>Anyone who lives in Little Thetford is eligible to become a member. Members get a say in how the CLT develops
          the community and what its priorities are. In the coming weeks we will be making membership available. Join
          the <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a> to stay informed about progress and as soon as membership is open we will let you know.
          Being a member doesn’t have any time commitments, you can get as involved as you want.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><b>How can I get involved?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>We are looking to spread the word about what we are trying to set up, so tell your friends, family and anyone
          else in the village.
          We are also looking to gauge demand for those who could benefit from a CLT, so those who are priced out of the
          housing market, looking for affordable rent, have children who have moved away, or want to live closer to your
          work.
          You can let us know all these things by signing up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a>.
          You can watch our developments on our Facebook Page @littlethetfordclt
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><b>I’m looking for a home?</b></button>
      <div class="question">
        <p>If you think a CLT could help you get your own home we really want to hear from you as you are the reason for
          it to exist. Please join our <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a>.</p>
