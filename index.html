    <div class="FAQs">
      <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>The following are the answers to commonly asked questions about Community Land Trusts and how they works.</p>
    <h3>What is a Community Land Trust (CLT)?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Across the UK, Community Land Trusts (CLTs) like Little Thetford CLT are being set
        up as non-profit organisations run by local volunteers to develop housing,
        workspaces and hold other assets, such as land that meet community needs.
        Typically, they enable people to live closer to work, schools and families. A CLT
        could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop homes for affordable rent for local people in perpetuity.</li>
        <li>Develop homes for sale as shared ownership or discounted market sale to help local people get their first
          step on the housing ladder.</li>
        <li>Develop community spaces; open green space, shared working space and amenities. </li>
        <li>Promote community development.</li>
        <li>Develop in a way which suits the needs of the village community!</li>
    </div>

    <h3>Why do we need a CLT?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>With house prices and rents being so high in the Cambridge area, many people find
        it hard to afford to rent or buy a home in Little Thetford, even if they are working full-
        time, lots of young professionals find they are stuck at home with mum and dad for
        longer than they would like. The CLT is set up to provide housing that is genuinely
        attainable for local people on local wages.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What are the benefits of a CLT?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>There are a number of benefits to setting up and running a CLT. Usually, the
        motivation is a desire to create affordable homes that are available to local people
        who cannot afford open market housing or rents. However, often local people might
        take on another challenge facing their community, such as setting up a community
        shop, a village hall or purchasing the local pub when it is about to close.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CLTs are locally driven, controlled and democratically accountable. </li>
        <li>CLTs can set its allocation policy, so it can set aside housing and develop to meet the needs of the local
          area. </li>
        <li>CLTs, by retaining an equity share in each property, provide housing that is permanently affordable,
          benefitting many generations of residents.</li>
        <li>CLTs give the community an asset for the future. </li>
        <li>CLTs genuinely empower local communities, where communities are part of the vision and solution for their
          local area. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>How does membership work?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>Anyone who lives in Little Thetford is eligible to become a member. Members get a say in how the CLT develops
        the community and what its priorities are. In the coming weeks we will be making membership available. Join
        the <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a> to stay informed about progress and as soon as membership is open we will let you know.
        Being a member doesn’t have any time commitments, you can get as involved as you want.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>We are looking to spread the word about what we are trying to set up, so tell your friends, family and anyone
        else in the village.
        We are also looking to gauge demand for those who could benefit from a CLT, so those who are priced out of the
        housing market, looking for affordable rent, have children who have moved away, or want to live closer to your
        work.
        You can let us know all these things by signing up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a>.
        You can watch our developments on our Facebook Page @littlethetfordclt
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>What should I do if I'm looking for a home?</h3>
    <div class="question">
      <p>If you think a CLT could help you get your own home we really want to hear from you as you are the reason for
        it to exist. Please join our <a href="http://eepurl.com/diMX-r">mailing list</a>.</p>
